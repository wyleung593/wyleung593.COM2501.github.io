        Viral marketing is a technique that promotes a product through existing social media networks. It leverages existing social media networks to promote a product or service. The term 'viral' implies the process of customers sharing information about a product with others, similar to how a virus spreads from person to person. Its name relates to how customers share information about a product with others. The traditional viral marketing concept is similar to the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. This strategy has recently gained immense popularity due to its perceived benefit of targeting a small group of individuals to seed an idea, product, or message that could go viral and reach millions. Companies can use traditional promotional strategies to plant potentially massive seeds. The advantages of viral marketing are its low cost and excellent ROI if a campaign is successful.

        <p>
        The success of viral marketing largely depends on the reproduction rate. When the rate is more than 1, each individual who receives the message will, on average, disseminate it to more than one additional person, who will then do the same, resulting in an exponential increase in the number of people who hear the message or become infected. When the rate is less than one, viral communications are generally regarded as failures because purely viral campaigns often begin with a limited number of seed cases and soon burn out unless their rate surpasses the epidemic threshold or tipping point of 1 and has a very low viral coefficient. However, unlike diseases, companies can use traditional promotional strategies to plant potentially massive seeds. Even if the rate is less than 1, if the initial seed is large enough, the burnout process will persist for numerous generations, reaching many more people. Marketers can also improve the rate of their message by providing easy-to-use social-sharing tools â€“ an essential point because even tiny improvements in the rate can significantly increase the number of subsequent cases.

        Ice Bucket Challenge
        </p>
        <p>
        The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge is an example of a successful viral marketing campaign. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease that affects around 5,600 people yearly. The challenge involves filming oneself being doused with ice water and publicly nominating three friends via social media to raise money for ALS research.
        </p>
        <p>
        The campaign's success can be attributed to several factors (Hughes, 2019). First, the challenge was accessible to most people and required minimal time and effort. Second, by spreading awareness about a noble cause positively and communally, the campaign tapped into human emotion, inspiring people to play their part, donate and share the vital message. Third, early on, the challenge was adopted by people with notable social media followings, creating a buzz that made it one of the most successful marketing campaigns ever.

        In addition to these factors, the campaign's humour was a significant driver of its overall success. Rather than trying too hard to convey a funny or quirky tone, the humour came organically from throwing ice on one's head. Finally, the hashtag #icebucketchallenge was leveraged throughout the campaign and became synonymous with popular culture. It expanded its global reach in a matter of weeks and resulted in 2.2 million Twitter mentions between July 29 and August 17, 2014 (Hughes, 2019).
