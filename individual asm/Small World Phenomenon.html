        The small-world phenomenon, illustrated by the "six degrees of separation," highlights the interconnectedness of individuals in social networks. Through experiments and mathematical models, it was discovered that short paths in networks are facilitated by a combination of local clustering and long-range shortcuts, which has implications for decentralized routing algorithms and network design in various fields (Kleinberg, 2004).

         This phenomenon does not mean that any connection between people must go through 6 steps, but it expresses such an important concept: between any two strangers, a certain amount of contact information can always produce necessary connections or relationships.

        With the advent of technology, people are able to connect with each other across vast distances like never before. A research study conducted by Edunov et al. (2016) found that the degree of separation between individuals is now smaller than it has been in the past. This means that people can have a much larger social circle than ever before, even with people they have never met in person. According to Edunov et al. (2016), people now have a large number of "friends" on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. These "friends" can include people from all over the world who share common interests, hobbies, or even just a mutual friend. By having a larger social circle, people are more likely to meet others who share their values, beliefs, and interests. In their study, Edunov et al. (2016) found that the degree of separation on Facebook is approximately 3.5. This highlights how interconnected our world has become and how technology has made it easier for us to connect with others, even if we are physically far apart.
