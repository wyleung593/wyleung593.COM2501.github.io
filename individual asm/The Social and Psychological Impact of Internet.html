    <h3 id="sec1">Introduction</h3>

        <p>
        In the modern era, the Internet has become an integral part of our daily lives, revolutionizing how we communicate, access information, and interact with the world. Its pervasive presence has brought about significant social and psychological impacts that have reshaped various aspects of human existence. Exploring and comprehending the enormous implications of the Internet on society and the human mind is crucial, especially as people depend more and more on it for information, entertainment, and social relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Internet has transformed how we consume information, leading to concerns about spreading misinformation and erasing critical thinking skills. The ease of access to vast amounts of data can overwhelm individuals, making it challenging to verify the credibility and accuracy of information. This has given rise to <a href="Echo%20Chamber.html" target=“_blank”>Echo Chamber</a> and <a href="Viral%20Marketing.html" target=“_blank”>Viral Marketing</a>, where individuals are exposed primarily to content that aligns with their existing beliefs, leading to polarization and a reduced ability to engage in constructive dialogue.
        </p>
        <p>
        Also, it has bridged vast distances and connected people from all corners of the globe. It brings <a href="Small%20World%20Phenomenon.html" target=“_blank”>Small World Phenomenon</a>. Social networking platforms, online communities, and instant messaging services have facilitated unprecedented levels of communication and interaction. People can now effortlessly connect with friends, family, and acquaintances, regardless of geographical boundaries. This interconnectedness has fostered a sense of global community and cultural exchange, enabling diverse perspectives and ideas to be shared on a massive scale.
        </p>
        <p>
        In summary, the Internet has had a significant influence on both society and the human psyche. It has completely changed how we interact, obtain information, and go about our daily lives. It has created new opportunities and promoted global connectedness, but it has also brought social and psychological difficulties. We must comprehend and manage these effects as we maintain a balanced and healthy connection with the Internet and navigate the always-changing digital world.

        Generation Y and the later generation
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Generation Y, also known as Millennials</strong>, refers to individuals born roughly between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s. They are the generation that came of age during the turn of the millennium and witnessed significant technological advancements, particularly the rise of the Internet and digital communication (Bolton et al., 2013). Millennials experienced the transition from analogue to digital technologies and played a key role in shaping the digital landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
        The later generation following Millennials is often referred to as <strong>Generation Z</strong>. This cohort encompasses individuals born from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s. Gen Z grew up in a world where the Internet and digital technologies were already deeply ingrained in society. They are considered the first digital natives, having never known a time without the Internet or smartphones. This generation is characterized by their fluency in technology and ability to adapt quickly to new digital platforms and tools.
