        An "echo chamber" is an enclosed environment where communication and repetition serve to magnify or reinforce preconceived notions (Walter et al.,2017). This can lead to increased social and political polarization and extremism. While the internet has expanded access to a wider variety of political information, it also makes it easier to expose oneself to ideologically supportive channels selectively. This can lead to a harmonious group of people developing tunnel vision, resulting in echo chambers that are detrimental to one's well-being and prevent people from noticing changes in language and culture involving groups other than their own.

        They are created when insiders distrust outsiders, leading to unchecked trust among insiders. This can result in isolation and a cult-like mentality. It is important to note that echo chambers exist on both the left and right of the political spectrum, and the internet can activate pre-existing political attitudes and turn them into actual political behaviour. Populist parties' online communication can have a stronger activating effect among individuals who share their political orientation. It is worth noting that echo chambers are not limited to the online world and may even be even more vital in offline social networks.

        The rise of populism in Europe is linked to the use of broadband internet and social media, which create echo chambers that reinforce political beliefs. Studies by Boulianne et al. (2020) explore the impact of echo chambers on voter mobilization and political polarization. While some argue that the internet can be a persuasive device, others suggest that it perpetuates political polarization.

        <p>
        The 2016 United States presidential election
        </p>
        <p>
        The study conducted by Lei et al. (2018) focused on the echo chamber effect on Twitter during the 2016 US election. By utilizing network analysis and big data analytics, the study discovered that Twitter communities discussing Trump and Clinton varied considerably in political homogeneity and opinion leadership. Certain opinion leaders were responsible for creating homogeneous communities. Twitter played a significant role during the election cycle, with over one billion tweets. The idea of opinion leadership is based on the theory of a two-step flow of information, which proposes that new ideas usually flow from the mass media to opinion leaders.

        It found that conversations about political candidates differed in their levels of political homogeneity. Twitter users who followed specific opinion leaders were more likely to be exposed to information and opinions that were consistent with their existing views. This phenomenon can lead to political polarization and reinforce users' established perspectives and opinions. 
        </p>
        <p>
        It also highlights the social networking affordances of Twitter, which can increase citizens' exposure to political discussion and confrontation. This exposure creates fertile ground for selective exposure and political homophily, where users tend to associate with others who share their political views. Overall, the study suggests that Twitter's impact on political discourse is significant and may have implications for how we view political polarization in the digital age.
